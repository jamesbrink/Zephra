# Vendored: zimage.swift

- **Upstream:** https://github.com/mzbac/zimage.swift
- **Vendored at:** `970f83e477028e81fc19fc7035228ced89dc1ffd` (`main`, 2025-12-20).
  Tag `0.1.2` predates the resident-pipeline API (`loadModel`, `generateToMemory`,
  progress callbacks), so `main` was used.
- **License:** MIT, per upstream `README.md` "License" section. The upstream
  repository has **no LICENSE file**; the text in `LICENSE` here is the standard
  MIT text with the upstream author as copyright holder.
- **Included:** `Sources/ZImage/**` (49 files, directory tree preserved verbatim).
- **Excluded:** `Sources/ZImageCLI`, `Tests/**`, `examples/**`, `images/**`.
